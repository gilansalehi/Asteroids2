Welcome to the Gauntlet Run!
--a game by Gilan Salehi --

![alt tag](Asteroids/assets/GauntletRun.PNG)

Race through the asteroid field destroying enemy scouts and cruisers and picking up powerups!  Defeat a horde of enemies and face down the final challenge: the Gauntlet itself.

A few tips:
Small asteroids can be destroyed, but larger ones are very tough.  
Beware the enemy scouts: they'll avoid asteroids where possible, but they won't hesitate to crash into you!
Hold space to fire; don't mash it.
You get points from shooting down enemies.  For instance, enemy scouts are 10 points each.
