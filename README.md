Welcome to the Gauntlet Run!
--a game by Gilan Salehi --

![./assets/GauntletRun.PNG]()

Race through the asteroid field destroying enemy scouts and cruisers and picking up powerups!  Defeat a horde of enemies and face down the final challenge: the Gauntlet itself.

A few tips:
Small asteroids can be destroyed, but larger ones are very tough.  
Beware the enemy scouts: they'll avoid asteroids where possible, but they won't hesitate to crash into you!
